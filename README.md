# Automatic System for Hydration
Our app keeps track of the user's health and fitness levels, along with other personalized information, and recommends a water-intake schedule based on their previous data. The schedule displays the amounts of water the user should drink at set times throughout the day, and it does this by knowing the tendencies they have during that day of the week, whether it be resting or some sort of activity.
